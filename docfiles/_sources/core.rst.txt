Network construction and manipulation
====================================

This section includes some basic information about the core multilayer data structure used in the py3plex library..
 
The multinet
------------

The multinet class is the main data structure used. Its functionality can be described in three simple points:

#. Network parsing
#. Network conversion
#. Network decomposition

Every time a new network is used, it needs to be packed into a simple object-line interface, as done below:
   
.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from py3plex.core import multinet
   
   # initialize the network object
   multilayer_network = multinet.multi_layer_network()

   # load the file
   multilayer_network.load_network("imdb_gml.gml",directed=False,label_delimiter="---")

   # compute some basic statistics
   multilayer_network.basic_stats()

Network parsers
---------------

Network parsers lie at the core of every network library. As py3plex is build on top of NetworkX package, it supports all parsers present there, for example:

* edgelist parsing (edgelist)
* gpickle compressed network parsing (gpickle)
* GML format (gml)
* networkx objects (nx)
* ...

The user must simply take care of the input file ending, or in the case of a raw networkx file, simply pass it as input.

The input type is specified using the *input_type* flag when using the *load_network* method.


Working with multilayer networks
--------------------------------

Having introduced some basic concepts, we continue with conventions, adopted to successfully work with multilayer networks.

#. Each not and edge can have a *type* flag assigned.
#. Each edge can have a *weight*.
#. Target node class (if specified), must have the *label* flag, where the value is a string representing different delimiter-separated classes. For example: class1---class2---class3 represent a node with 3 classes assigned (multiclass-multilabel problem.

The *label_delimiter* is specified when inputting the network

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
      
   load_network(input_file="example.gpickle", directed=False, input_type="gpickle",label_delimiter="---"):


Examples
--------

Load a gml file:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
      
   multilayer_network.load_network(input_file="example.gml", directed=False, input_type="gml"):


Load a gpickle file:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
      
   multilayer_network.load_network(input_file="example.gpickle", directed=False, input_type="gpickle"):


Load a gpickle file, with one type of nodes labeled:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
      
   multilayer_network.load_network(input_file="example.gpickle", directed=False, input_type="gpickle",label_delimiter="---"):

etc.
